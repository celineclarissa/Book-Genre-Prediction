# Book Genre Prediction 📚
This repository showcases how I analyzed characteristics of books based on genre and developed a model that can predict the genre of a book based on the book summary with NLP technique. Achieved accuracy rate of 23% and evaluated the model’s strengths and weaknesses. The analysis and model is deployed on Hugging Face for effective use. 

## Background ❓
I am a data scientist at a book distribution company. As a company, it is important to know the characteristics of books in order to sort books based on its genre. The information can then be used to make strategies based on book genre.

## Problem Statement 🔍
As a data scientist at a book distribution company, skills of training, testing, tuning, and evaluating a model are important because the company can then use the model to predict the genre of a book before accepting to distribute it. The company can then determine a business strategy like planning a choosing books to distribute based on genre, for example. This can be done by using data. After analyzing book genre characteristics from EDA, data scientist will then do feature engineering towards data. Then, data scientist will do modelling with ANN to predict genre of book. Then, data scientist will attempt to improve model. The best model is aimed to have an accuracy score of more than 90% and then deployed on HuggingFace for effective use after 7 working days. Webapp where model is deployed will also feature a page for EDA.
